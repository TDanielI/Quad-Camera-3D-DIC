Handpick guide:

1. Load all 4 images into the same folder as manual_points.m
2. Put the file names into file_1 until file_4 on the code (line 10)
3. Change the number of corresponding points you want to choose (feature_points) (minimum: 8, default: 10) (line 151)
4. Press run
5. Output files:
	img_file_info       : contains the image file that is associated with each direction (N, E, S, W) which is useful for future processes and the direction for "up" as the videos are rotated.
	feature_data_export : contains the coordinates of corresponding points (i,j,k)
										i       : the number of corresponding points * 2
										j=1     : up or down (+1: up, -1: down)
										j=2&3   : x and y coordinates of the point
										k       : [N, E, S, W] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
										Example : i=n will correspond to i=n+feature_points
