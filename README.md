Quad-Camera-3D-DIC
==================

This project contains the tools needed to reconstruct the 3D structure of a dog-bone specimen under tensile deformation using videos captured from 4 different angles.

Here's an example of the 3D reconstruction obtained from sample X.
(TODO: Add example here once we're done)

Features
--------

- Frame extraction from video
- Convenient GUI for the manual labelling of keyframe features
- Geometry extraction of the stereo correspondence problem
- 3D reconstruction through pixel-wise dense correspondence

Installation
------------

For the MATLAB version, simply clone our repository and run (TODO: insert name of main function here, with syntax accordingly).

For the Python version, run

	pip install kornia

Contribute
----------

As of the moment our project does not accept open contribution.
